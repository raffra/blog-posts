Eating fat does not make you fat


The plot of [The Non-Fat Yogurt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Non-Fat_Yogurt), an episode of [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld), centers on whether or not the yogurt Jerry and Elaine are eating contains fat. Both characters are gaining weight and (mistakely) believe that if the yogurt truly had no fat, they would not have become heavier. They send a yogurt sample to a lab and the results confirm their suspicons and explain why they are becoming fat.

The premise of the show touches on a common misconception about weight gain. The fat content of your diet has little to do with whether you lose or gain fat. What really matters is how many calories you eat.

Every day your body uses a number of calories (a unit of energy) to power vital bodily functions. Fat is produced when someone eats too many calories. If Jerry has a [total daily energy expenditure (TDEE)](https://healthyeater.com/important-tool-weight-loss) of 2000 calories and eats 2500 calories in one day the extra 500 calories will convert to 0.14lb of fat (3500cal = 1lb of fat). 

It does not matter where the extra calories come from. A low fat diet of 2500cal will make Jerry just as fat as a high fat diet of 2500cal. Likewise, if Jerry were to eat a high fat diet of 1500 calories/day he would actually *lose* 0.14lb of fat per day. The number of calories a person eats determines if someone will lose of gain fat, not how many grams of fat they eat.






So eat as much fat as you want, just make sure you count your calories and keep it under your TDEE.

One reason low fat diets "work" is that fat is very energy dense. One tablespoon of oil has roughly same number of calories as an apple


Reducing fat from a diet is an easy way to make you feel full while reducing the calories you eat. 





A diet of 2500 calories produced from entirely protein 




If someone eats more calories than they can burn in one day, the body stores the excess energy as fat. If your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) is 2000 calories and you eat 2350 calories the extra 350 calories will convert to 0.1lb of fat. 



There are 3 macronutrients which are the main sources of calories: Protein, Carbohydrates, and Fat. One gram of protein or carb contains 4 calories. One gram of fat contains 9 calories. 




Fat has nothing to do with becoming fat. 

The amount of fat someone eats is only loosely related to gaining weight. What really matters is how many calories you eat. 

Fat is our body's way of storing excess energy. Your body will only synthesize fat cells when you have eaten more calories than you can burn in a day. Likewise if you eat fewer calories than your body demands, fat cells are "burned" to release extra energy. 

Gaining weight has very little to do with how much fat you eat. All that matters is how many calories you burn in a day vs how many calories you eat.
